I have no idea what I'm doing. Any pointers would be great. The code is a complete mess as I try to break and fix at the same time. Basic web app where I'm looking to replace my current paper form with a digital sheet that will save in any format to a local file.

Form Page 1
Form data is pulled forward to page 2.
Signature pad not working.
Upon hitting submit  - two actions  - Page 1 file will save as; HH followed by a three digit number dash then the address. (ie. HH103 - address of location). Checked boxes will need to be visible on the saved document. 
                                      Is there a way to hide boxes that are not checked so that they do not save?
                                    - Page 2 will pickup contact information to be submitted with page drawing.

Page 2 will save as HH followed by a three digit number dash then address - 2. Drawing pad picture will need to be saved in document.

There are a number of other checkboxes to be added. 
There will need to be a text box for additional information to be added to the form.
